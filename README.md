Challenge 2: Advanced CSS
For this challenge we've been tasked with creating a portfolio website from scratch. In addition to serving as a portfolio to use in our future professional career. We are asked to implement some of the advanced CSS techniques that we have learned in the previous week. Some of the advanced techniques we are asked to use are the use of media queries and pseudo-elements.
The pseudo elements while challenging were fun to work with. It was quite rewarding to see simple animations reacting to mouse hovers and clicks. On the other hand I struggled quite a bit with the media queries and personally am not satisfied with the results. I forsee myself working on this website off and on for the next several months while I learn new things and sharpen my skills.
